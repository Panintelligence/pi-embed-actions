## Pi Embed Actions

-----------------

`pi-embed-actions` is a lightweight JavaScript library designed to simplify interactions between your application and the Pi app embedded within an iframe. It offers a straightforward API to execute actions directly within the embedded Pi app, reducing the need for manual input and simplifying the integration of 
Pi into your app.

The library acts as a wrapper to facilitate various actions, such as opening a report editor, with plans to introduce additional actions in the future to further automate tasks and enhance the APIâ€™s capabilities.
